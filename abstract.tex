\textbf{} 

\par This traineeship report was made in the scope of the traineeship inserted in the master's degree in Computer Engineering -Internet of Things at the School of Technology of Tomar from the Polytechnic Institute of Tomar, and has a goal place in real environment the knowledge acquired in the academic path.

\par The traineeship has inherent 4 associated projects at the area of IOT and the monitoring of environments and/or objects using different solutions. One of the projects, "Nidus" already existed and it is necessary to analyze the project to continue the support of Front-end. In this project, it is necessary to study and change the page development methods related to file compression to reduce the space occupied by the WEB pages, the adoption of a better method for using images on the WEB interfaces on equipment with low resources and the development of new features such as an internalization system in order to make the equipment available in other languages. The remaining projects will be developed from scratch during the traineeship, or by clients requesting custom solutions or by the innovation/evolution of the company's products, and consist of new equipments for monitoring, namely environmental monitoring and Tracking of objects.

\par The second project is relative of the development of an IOT device that takes advantage of the new communication technology NB-IOT. In this equipment it is possible to add several sensors, and the equipment is able to perform the readings of the various sensors, storage in Log for later upload to a Cloud portal for future preview or make alerts.
\par In parallel with the previous project and with the emergence of new technologies such as Bluetooth Low Energy Beacons and the request by several customers for a new portable and simple monitoring solution, the "Kea Tracker" project was created, composed with several Beacons and an application Mobile responsible for reading the sensors present in Beacons and upload them to the Cloud portal. In this project, Beacon must also have an internal Log system for communication failure with the Mobile application.
\par The last project of the traineeship, requested by the client, is based on the development of a solution composed of Sensors and Gateways and a WEB platform that makes it possible to Tracking people and objects in indoor environments and thus manage access times, create alerts, or simply manage the stock of warehouses. This project uses as support technology Bluetooth Low Energy Beacons (BLE) to do real-time tracking.
