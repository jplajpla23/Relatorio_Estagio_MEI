@article{Alakuijala2015,
abstract = {—​ This paper compares six compression techniques, and based on the results proposes that brotli could be used as a replacement of the common deflate algorithm. We compared the performance of brotli by measuring the compression ratio and speed, as well as decompression speed on three different corpora: the Canterbury compression corpus, an ad hoc crawled web content corpus, and enwik8. On all three corpora we show performance superior to that of deflate. Further, we show that Zopfli, LZMA, LZHAM and bzip2 use significantly more CPU time for either compression or decompression and could not always work as direct replacements of deflate.},

@article{Alakuijala2019,
abstract = {Brotli is an open source general-purpose data compressor introduced by Google in late 2013 and now adopted in most known browsers and Web servers. It is publicly available on GitHub and its data format was submitted as RFC 7932 in July 2016. Brotli is based on the Lempel-Ziv compression scheme and planned as a generic replacement of Gzip and ZLib. The main goal in its design was to compress data on the Internet, which meant optimizing the resources used at decoding time, while achieving maximal compression density. This article is intended to provide the first thorough, systematic description of the Brotli format as well as a detailed computational and experimental analysis of the main algorithmic blocks underlying the current encoder implementation, together with a comparison against compressors of different families constituting the state-of-the-art either in practice or in theory. This treatment will allow us to raise a set of new algorithmic and software engineering problems that deserve further attention from the scientific community.},

@article{Wang2013,
abstract = {Location based services are the hottest applications on mobile devices nowadays and the growth is continuing. Indoor wireless positioning is the key technology to enable location based services to work well indoors, where GPS normally could not work. Bluetooth has been widely used in mobile devices like phone, PAD etc. therefore Bluetooth based indoor positioning has great market potential. Radio Signal Strength (RSS) is a key parameter for wireless positioning. New Bluetooth standard (since version 2.1) enables RSS to be discovered without time consuming pre-connection. In this research, general wireless positioning technologies are firstly analysed. Then RSS based Bluetooth positioning using the new feature is studied. The mathematical model is established to analyse the relation between RSS and the distance between two Bluetooth devices. Three distance-based algorithms are used for Bluetooth positioning: Least Square Estimation, Three-border and Centroid Method. Comparison results are analysed and the ways to improve the positioning accuracy are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

@article{Zhu2014,
abstract = {Received signal strength indication (RSSI) is used in most cases of the localization system for its advantages of simplicity, requiring no additional hardware and low-cost. However, due to the irregular fluctuation, there are certain measured RSSIs which do not follow the empirical path loss model, while estimating the location of the blind node. So it's quite difficult to achieve high location accuracy. In this paper, according to the geometrical constraint between each distance, we propose a geometrical constrained least square estimation (GC-LSE) algorithm. This algorithm can both deal with the large errors that are mainly caused by the environmental change, and small errors that come from the devices' difference and operation mistakes. By reducing these errors we can greatly improve the location performance. With the numerical results from practical experiments, GC-LSE algorithm is proved to have a substantial improvement on location accuracy.},
